In addition to shootings on public places, cliché rift between black/white people often agitates news and press and stirs up American society. For this project we will use data from Chapel Hill Open Data, which is about the crime in this state By using the CHPD database, far from finding a universal answer applicable to the United States of America in a whole because our sample does not allow us to do so, we have the possibility of considering the socio-demographic characteristics of offenders and police officers over a defined period and time span in order to check whether the clichés of the cleavage can be confirmed or refuted. The use of this database potentially allows us to identify some potentially significant correlations between factors of delinquency or bias among police officers Our goal is to find some significant correlation between the variables in order to profile the different offenders and see if these profiles infer with the typical characteristics of police profiles. Does the concentration of police officer profiles have a link with the profiles of offenders, the offences committed or the satisfaction of the population with the service they receive from the police? From sociodemographic of the people arrested do stem some insight on some contributing factors of arrestation among a certain type of population or a precise distribution of delinquency among the socio demographics? 1.2 The data As mentioned above ,for this assignement we use then Chapel Hill Crime and Police Data. These sets of datasets will focus on datasets gathered from Chapel Hill Open Data, which is managed and run by the town of chapel hill. This readme is a compilation of information that represents what each file will be about. Most of the datasets can be understood by reading the summary page from the Chapel Hill Open Data website We are going to use four differents tables. We didn’t have to do any data cleansing. We just renamed the names of a few observations so that the reader could understand what they were about. 1.2.1 Police Incidents Reports Written This dataset contains incident reports filed with the Chapel Hill Police Department. Multiple incidents may have been reported at the same time. The most serious incident is shown for each report filed. Data available since January 1, 2010 and updated quarterly. Observations: 82’525 Variables: 18 For this project, we are going to use the 6 variables present in the table 1.1. Those variables seems to be the most important for our project. Table 1.1: Table incident reports Date of Report Date of Occurrence Reported As Victim Age Victim Race Victim Gender 2019-06-29 2019-06-29 THEFT/LARCENY 21 W F 1.2.2 Drivers and Passengers Searched By Sex Race and Ethnicity This dataset contains data on drivers and passengers searched during traffic stops, broken down by sex, race, and ethnicity. Observations: 8 Variables: 14 In the table 1.2, you have an overview of the variables present in this dataset. Further, for our project we are going only to take into account black and white race, as the other seems to be less significant.

["exploration-analysis.html", "Chapter 2 Exploration analysis 2.1 Incident reports 2.2 Police arrested made. 2.3 Traffic data", " Chapter 2 Exploration analysis In order to have a global overview about our table, we are going to have a zoom on each differents table. ##Employee demographics We start to analyse the dataset of the police officers. This data base records sociodemographics information on the units of the CHPD, including their matriculation number, Job Class Description, Status, Age, Service Years, Gender and Race. We would like to know the proportion of the ethnicities among police officers ans we can observe in the figure 2.1. This distribution is captured in the current year of 2016. Figure 2.1: Distribution of the employee Now our interest is to know which positions are the most occupied and by whom? Looking at the distribution of the job class in the figure 2.1, we note that mostly all the police function is attribute to white male people.It is an interesting point for further analysis. Table 2.1: Profession of the police officers by frequency Job Class Description Gender Race Number of employee POLICE OFFICER IV Male White 27 POLICE OFFICER II Male White 12 RESERVE POLICE OFFICER Male White 11 POLICE OFFICER III Male White 9 POLICE SERGEANT Male White 9 POLICE LIEUTENANT Male White 8 POLICE OFFICER I Male White 8 We found interesting to focus on the job class what are in the field or in the hierarchy of those job classes, with regards to the aim of our project. We filtered thus Job Classes Despcription to obtain a subset including: “POLICE OFFICER I”, “POLICE OFFICER II”, “POLICE OFFICER III”,“POLICE OFFICER IV”, “POLICE SERGEANT”, “POLICE CAPTAIN”, “POLICE CHEF”, “POLICE LIEUTENANT”, “POLICE CHEF-ASSISTANT”, and most of them figure in the table 2.1 as the more reccurent. According to some studies run in the field, a chronic stress caused by police work is an explaination of the use of extralegal force (see Griffin and Bernard 2003, 3–21). In order to set this assumption, we run two investigations: Figure 2.2 depicts the modes of the service lengths among genders, for the job cited right above. We observe that the service length is slightly longer for men than for women. The median ongoing career length for men is 15 years, whereas the women’s is approximatively 6 years shorter (-40%). Even if newcomers lower the ongoing service length, such as the outlier in men’s category, we observe that men are thus exposed on a longer period to a chronic stress, which is inherent to the job of police officer (More into details Purba 2019) Figure 2.2: Distribution of the police job Considering now the gender among all categories of job classes, we observe that the police officers are mostly male teams, 2.2. Out of the four grades, there are only 4 women. Women occupy mostly administrative jobs, not linked to the process nor decision making about arrestation. In this way, we can keep in mind that our analysis would focus mainly on male officers. Figure 2.3: Distribution of the job by gender In order to contextualize this information, we had to know when those police officers started their career. We computed easily the age of enrollment, which is the result of their age minus their service length. The age at which the officers began their career is an important important information, because the young people are more mentally vulnerable than older ones (Thomas et al., 2016). Starting one’s career at a young age and being exposed to a chronic stress and traumatic events have more impact on the subject due to one’s age. Among filtered job categories, the starting age is under 30 years old in average, as we observe in the 2.2. All officiers were thus early exposed to chronic stress, and more longer if they gained grades. The hierarchy cumulate more years of experience, between 16 years old for the sergeant to 19 for the captain. It is intuitive because of the system of reward and the legitimization to obtain this position: the contrary would have been surprising.The hierarchy is not necessarily playing a direct role in the field. Yet, they give orders and guidelines to the police officers, installing a certain culture and mindset to the troops. Police officers’ starting age takes part in the same interval than for their superior : between 25 and 30 years old. We have two police officers above this age, what could be explain by either a late career or a change in district. Howver, it seems that to reach the fourth level in police officer scale, the experience is a necessary element. Those policemens do not have less than 13 years old of experience, which is a large amount of time spent, by assumption, in streets and on missions. For now, we have to ascertain if only those job classes follow the trend of young enrollment or if it is a general tendancy respected by all the human ressources of the CHPD. Figure 2.4: Distribution of the job by gender 2.5 Figure 2.5: Distribution of the job by race 2.1 Incident reports Now we are going to go through the victim data. We wanted to know how many victims occurred each year and who are they?As a reminder, the data are included for the years 2010 to 2019. In Figure 2.6, there is a huge difference the race of the victim. But we notice that the victim are either male either female.As a first step we can conclude that the gender is not a determinant factor to determine a victim, but the race seems a signifcant variable. Figure 2.6: Distribution about the type of the victim Now that we know the distribution of victims, it would be interesting to know what type of crime it is. Therefore, in table ?? , we can see that the majority of the crimes in question are crimes involving theft.And the two others majoritary crime are “misc officier in” and “domestic distur”. Table 2.2: Purpose of the crime Reported As Victim Race Victim Gender Number of victim THEFT/LARCENY White Male 957 THEFT/LARCENY White Female 898 MISC OFFICER IN White Female 442 DOMESTIC DISTUR Black Female 391 MISC OFFICER IN White Male 379 DOMESTIC DISTUR White Female 356 BURGLARY/HOME I White Male 319 PUBLIC SERVICE White Female 311 SUSPICIOUS/WANT White Female 309 BURGLARY/HOME I White Female 306 Outliers are the typical cases showing this uncontrollable variation, we would neglect them and filter our dataset to observe only the delays inferior to 2000 days (more than 3 years). We observe that the time dedicated to investigation and arrestation for cases of white people is slightly higher than this time for black people. We would discard the assumption of a negligence in the treatment of cases related to black people. In the figure 2.7, we would like to know if there is a difference in process time for registering the complaint and the the arrestation process among race of victims. Even if there are some variations depending on the complexity of the case and the inherent time of investigation depending on the type of case, variation we cannot control, it would be interesting if there are anyway a global difference since our panel of 82’525 observations would somehow pool this variance. Figure 2.7: Bloxplot about the delay between the occurence and the report 2.2 Police arrested made. In the data “Police arrested made”, there are all the data of the criminals for their arrest from 2010 to 2019.The first thing we wished to observe is the number of arrests per month and per year (for a better visualization) classified by race of the criminal. In Figures 2.8 and 2.9, we observe that from 2015, the number of arrestation for black people increase. The below figures shows the number of arrestation by race and we note the equivalent proportion of black and white arestees. However, if we confront this information with the socio-demographic data of White Chapel in 2010, the black population represented only 9.9%. According to the data of 2020 World Population by Country(updated daily) displaying the population of Chapel Hill and its population growth, the population growth between 2010 and 2018 was 6.24 %, so let’s assume that the population of black people increased by the same percentage, and the variation would be +/- 6.24 [0% or 12.48%.] It would lead that in 2018, on year before our data, we should have 10.5% of black people in White Chapel Hill or a percentage included in [9.9% ; 11.17%]. Here, if we had to respect the proportion in the arrestee sample according to the white people number of arestee, should be around 386 black arestee, in order to be representative of the whole population. 3’651 black arrestees represent 945% of this extrapolation. Since 2015, the trend is inverted and black people are sometimes more arrested than white people. Sometimes, the difference is shocking, for instance in March-April and July-August 2016 or June-July 2018. These differences are peaks that could be related to the meeting and strikes related to black shooting occuring in the year and to repeal a a law (HB2), as those articles relate to following article (Grubb 2020, title “Hundreds block downtown Chapel Hill to protest state’s HB2 law”) We do neglect the possibility that mass movements could as well explain unusual peaks. However, as we mentioned earlier, the inverted trend is significantly verified in 2017, where white arrestees were a majority only during two first months. This fact could not be explained by mass movements. Figure 2.8: Evolution of the number of arrestation by month Figure 2.9: Evolution of the number of arrestation by year After dividing the arrests by class, we wanted to know the gender of the arrestees and we observed, in the figure 2.10, that the number of men is in average 3 times the number of arrested women, both races combined. The male arrestees number remains above the 600 for white and for black (except in 2012, around 580) from 2010 to 2015. Until that date, Black arrestees’ number belongs to an approximate interval of [580;800], with a high increase between 2012-2015 (approx. +35%). White arrestees belongs to the interval [600:800]. Both races decreases tremendously afterwards, but the black community always remains higher of +50 numbers of arrestees in average, which denotes well the disparity among races. In 2015, some institutional policy must have been applied to decrease the number of arrestee preventively or punishingly because the number of arrestees has decreased for both white and black citizens. The trend of a decrease in the number of arrestees is observed one year later for women: in 2016. Women arrestees number is quite stable, oscillating in an interval of [100;200] for white women and [50;150] Figure 2.10: Evolution of the number of arrestation between male and female And what about their ages? The age and the race would complete the profile of our arrestees. White arrestees are slightly younger (27-28 yo) considering the median than black people (34-35yo), Even the 1rst and 3rd modes are present a difference of about 5 years, making black arestees older. And we note that the mean age of black arrestee in slightly superior to the white arestee mean age. The mean ages are respectedly 33 years for black people and 25 for white people, as observed in the figure 2.11. Figure 2.11: Age of the arrested people related to the race We would now consider the type of arrestation 2.12.Black arestees have more chance to be taken into custody than white people (until 2 times, in 2011). The difference in proportion of race pu into cuatody remains quite stable, each year verifying the schocking gap between white and black arrestees taken into custody. Since 2012, the black proportion of peolple summoned or cited increased to reach 300 arrestees per year, in 2015 and 2016. The curve for white arrestees depicts a yearly decrease in the number of white arrestees, starting in 2010 with a number higher than 400, reaching a flat stage for about 3 years (2012-2015) and the decreased has accelerated since this moment. However, we not that in this category as well, the curves of respectively black and white people arrested has become mixed for the past 5 years, making this sample as well not representative for the entire population. The same comment could be made for arrestees on view, with a tinier gap between white and black people, but always at the cost of black persons. Figure 2.12: Number of arrestation separeted by type and race 2.3 Traffic data After investigating on the proportion of behavioral causes of arrests, we decided again to differentiate black to white people. To do so, we chose an alternative method based on percentage: a ratio determining how many black citizens more were arrested for a certain motive of arrestto, scaled by the number of white arrestees, per year. The most striking information is the ratio is the highest for investigation. In other words, for each 10 white citizen arrested for investigation, whatever the gender is, at least 16 black persons already have been arrested. Those 60% of difference between those two races clearly signifies a causal disproportion. However, narrowing down the specific cause of it is impossible and is not part of the present work. The reader has to keep in mind the black inhabitants’ proportion in demographics dated 2010 in Chapel Hill (10%) and our extrapolation: (+/- 1.2%) per year, with respect to the whole population. The present arrestees sample is absolutely not representative of our population, even if estimated. In Figure 2.13, if the bar is higher than 50%, it mean that more black are arrested and inversely. We note that for the purpose “Investigation”, more black are arrested for the both year and independig of the genre of the person. Driving while impaired concern more the black male people.The most striking information is the ratio is the highest for investigation. In other words, for each 10 white citizen arrested for investigation, whatever the gender is, at least 16 black persons already have been arrested.

The present arrestees sample is absolutely not representative of our population, even if estimated. Figure 2.13: More black are arrested In order to better understand the dataset of car arrestation, we want to know what type of arrest prevails per year 2.14. The strict majority among categories is speed limit violation, which overpass 4’000 arrestations per year, in both 2014 and 2015, and whose gender proportion approximate a 55%-45%. Speed violation is a daily risk for drivers, whether it is done voluntary or not and for this reason speed violation was an easy bet as the first cause of verbalization. The second and third causes of arrest concerned violation of vehicle regulations or equipment regulations. Which is interesting to note here is that the first causes of arrests, whose number of occurences exploded in 2014 and 2015, concerns a behavioral cause. Other behavioral causes are fewly reported: (safe or other) movement violations, driving whiled impaired, etc. Offensive or violent behaviors are not significantly represented here other than potentially trhough speed violation which, as we previously said, could be unwanted.

["modeling.html", "Chapter 3 Modeling 3.1 Modeling - Arrested 3.2 Modelling - Victim 3.3 Prediction", " Chapter 3 Modeling 3.1 Modeling - Arrested 3.1.1 With a normal distribution Once the exploration analysis done, we pursue with the modelization of the profile of our arrestees and victims. As a gentle reminder, the aim of our project is to build the typical profil drawn by the database in order to know whether or not race has a strong influence and thus, to consider if there is objectively a partial legal force. We would first build the model for arrestee’s profile. In order to do so, we use the General Linear Model to shape our dependent variable, the number of arrestation, explain by our independent variables: the age, race and gender of the arrestee and if it was under the influence of drugs and alcool. We use dummy variables to better understand the impact of the outcomes. We observe that ceteris paribus, approximatively 49 arrestations (intercept) would be done in our reference case as we could observe in the table 3.1. The reference case is the average of possibility between all combinations possible with our variable references and here, since we have dummy variables, it encompasses the lowest probable profile of arrestees: black women. This reference level gives the irreductible number of arrestations the Chapel Hill Police District would operate for this category per XXX. The arrestee Age has a negative effect: it depicts that higher is the age of the arrestee lower is the probability to encounter this person, since a high age would decrease, ceteris paribus, the number of arrestations in fine by the exact value of the age of the arrestee. This coefficient is significant. The other significant coefficients are the gender of the arrestee and the presence of drugs and alcool, the last information is divided into two significant dummy variables. Being a male would higher by almost 29 additional arrestations, ceteris paribus. The male gender has a strong effect: + 58.10% of arrestations. Drugs and alcohol dummy variables have as wellspring effects: The unknown presence of those substances decrease our outcome by approx. 16 arrestations (-15.63), ceteris paribus, while their presence would increase by almost 19 arrestations (18.83). Unfortunately, this model does not give us the expect insight on race: being white is positively correlated with the number of arrestation, making white race a more probable characteristic in the typical arrestee profile. We should have intuitively deducted that indeed, however the coefficient is not significant.

To know it, we have to analyse the goodness of fit of the model and explore in more details the distribution of the errors and also the distribution or our data. In Figure 3.1, we observe exterme value, which have a lot of weight concerning the distribution of our errors, therefore we have chosen to remove these extreme values in order to better visualize the distribution of our errors. Figure 3.1: Residuals of the models about the arrested With the following table 3.4, we have a look on those extreme value and about the more current profile of the arrested. The standard profile is a young white male, with drogs or alcohol present. Table 3.2: Information about the estimate of the model Arrestee’s Age Arrestee’s Race Arrestee’s Gender Drugs or Alcohol Present arrestation 21 White Male Yes 331 20 White Male Yes 294 19 White Male Yes 260 22 White Male Yes 260 18 White Male Yes 172 23 White Male Yes 155 24 White Male Yes 155 After removing these extreme values, we observe in the figure 3.2 that the errors are normally distributed with 0 as mean (because we predicts only positive value, the bell curve is non existant on the left-hand side of the y-axis, but can be expected). It means that the values of errors are close to zero, leading to very low RMSE and MAE. This is a very good point. In addition, the curve of error values verifies as well the assumption of normal distribution. Now, are they randomly distributed? Figure 3.2: Residuals of the models about the arrested Concerning the predictions of our response variable “Arrestation”, we can observe in the figure 3.3, that our predictions and our observed values overlap, which is good news. On the other hand, our model has difficulty in predicting extreme values, especially for the white race. Figure 3.3: Prediction But unfortunately we are not satisfied that our model. Because we noticed that the residues are very high and that our data do not follow a normal dsitribution. Therefore, now we are make the same model, but assuming a poisson distribution. 3.1.2 With a poisson distribution Normal distribution describes continuous data which have a symmetric distribution, with a characteristic ‘bell’ shape, which is not the case in our data, as we observed in the figure 3.1. Therefore we made a mistake, therefore in the following part, we are going to use the same model but with a poisson distribution. We note that all our estimate are significant with 1% except for the variable race as we observe in the table @ref(tab:Table-estimate_poisson). We note that with a normal distribution (3.1) the sginifcant variables were the same. The change is for the intercept, which is slightly smaller than previously, 3.84 instead of 49.24. The effect of the estimate are the same. Ans as previsouly, variable race isn’t significant.

And we we have a zoom of this new residuals distribution, we note our residuals find themselves in an interval of [-10,10], which is pretty good. (#fig:Residuals_poisson)Residuals of the models about the arrested Again, after removing the extrme value, we compare the residuals between the 2 distributions, as we can observe in the @ref(tab:Residuals-2_poisson). And we come to the same conclusion as before. The residuals as less important for the poisson distribution. The residuals are clearly centered around 0 (#fig:Residuals-2_poisson)Residuals of the models about the arrested In the next model, we add the type of arrest and whether the criminal is armed or not, in order to explain our response variable “Arrest”. And this time, we use directly a poisson distribution. model_Arrestation_2 = glm(arrestation ~ `Arrestee&#39;s Age`+`Arrestee&#39;s Race`+`Arrestee&#39;s Gender` + `Drugs or Alcohol Present` + `Type of Arrest` + `Weapon Present`,family=&quot;poisson&quot;, data= Arrestation_2) Compare to our previous model with less variables, the significance of the estimate does not change. But we note that the type of arrestation “taken into custody” and being “unarmed” are signidicant with 5%, as we observe in the table 3.4.

Again, we use a General Linear model to estimate the number of victims by population characteristics per XXXX, by taking into account the age, race and gender of the victims. Again, we have a model with dummy variables, so we have to first consider our reference level, which is black women again, as we observe in the table 3.5. The irreductible number of victime for those population, neglecting the age is approximatively 201 cases (200.56). This number is significant. Considering now our variables: The age is negatively correlated with the number of victim by decreasing it with an effect of -2.70! We expect thus a larger number of young victims, since this coefficient is reliable since significant. Being white is risk factor: more victims are white and this is represented by the strong positive effect of the dummy variable, significant as well, called Victim RAceWhite: +86.79 so additional 87 numbers of victims by comparison to our reference level. Here, we have a strong racial effect: black people are less subject to misuse, aggressions, etc. than white people. Our database cannot help any supporting justification with demographics, because it does not contain any data on wealth, privileges, other objective or subjective factors causing people to aggress them. Finally, the interesting point remains that gender is not significant, in spite of the negative effect (in the model, but a benefit in reality) to be a male. Being a male decreases, ceteris paribus, the number of cases by approximatively 13 victims (13.42). Table 3.5: Information about the estimate of the model term estimate std.error p.value (Intercept) 200.6 10.05 0 *** Victim Age -2.7 0.15 0 *** Victim GenderMale -13.4 6.79 0.0489 * Victim RaceWhite 86.8 6.80 0 *** The errors are distributed around zero, leading to low errors scores, satisfying! But some errors remains as outliers, Errors value follow a gaussian distribution here as well, illustrating quite a poisson curve. In Figure 3.4, we observe Figure 3.4: Residuals of the models about the model victim In order to well undersant what is inside the extreme value as we obsevre the figure 3.4, we present the seven typical profil of a victim , in the table @ref(tab:Table_distribution-Victim), we notice that the victim is all the time a young white person. Table 3.6: Information about the estimate of the model Victim Age Victim Gender Victim Race Victim 21 Female White 755 21 Male White 636 22 Female White 513 20 Female White 510 22 Male White 481 20 Male White 462 19 Female White 324 After removing these extreme values,the error variation is oscillating around zero, 3.5, following no identifiable pattern: we might say they are randomly distributed. Both initial assumptions are verifies, our model seems to be well-built!! The box plot of the model’s goodness of fit points out that our model better predict black than white people: the dummy variable struggles to well fit the observation. Figure 3.5: Dstribution of the residuals The box plot of the model’s goodness of fit points out that our model better predict black than white people: the dummy variable struggles to well fit the observation, as we notice in the figure 3.6 Figure 3.6: Prediction victim model Like the model with arrested, we made an error making the assumption that are data follow a normal distribution, but it was not the case as we note obersving the distribution of the data in the figure 3.5. Therefore, now we assume that our data follow a poisson distribution. Again, we have a model with dummy variables, so we have to first consider our reference level, which is black women again, as we observe in the table ??. All the variables are significant as in the previsous table with a normal distribution 3.5. But here, all the variables are significant with 1%, which it was not the case previously. Here the varaibles male is negatively signicant, and before it was positively correlated. It is more correct to use this following table ??. (#tab:Table-estimate-victim_poisson)Information about the estimate of the model term estimate std.error p.value (Intercept) 5.50 0.02 0 *** Victim Age -0.03 0.00 0 *** Victim GenderMale -0.14 0.01 0 *** Victim RaceWhite 1.10 0.01 0 *** Plotting our residuals with a poisson distribution we note that we are pretty good,??. Figure 3.7: Residuals of the models about the model victim Removing the extreme value, again we note that with a poisson distribution, it is more correct, Figure 3.8: Residuals of the models about the arrested 3.3 Prediction Finally, because no variable concerning the arrestee’s race was significant, we would now see with a machine learning process if the black box is able to well predict the skin color of the person arrested. If the process succeeds, then there would be an evidence that black or white race might have an affect on arrestation in the District of Chapel Hill because they can be predicted by the variables we selected for the model: the characteristics of the arrestations would be a key factor to forecast the skin color of the arrestee. If not, then our data base does not allow us to demonstrate any bias in the judicial system of a county if ad only if our samples are respresentative of our population. If this is not the case, then further investigation have be done in order to minimize the sampling bias we face here. So, we filtered again the data to have only black and white arrestees and mutate all the character variables as factors, so as to be handled by the functions, which require factors only. We proceed to a sammpling for having a training and a test sets with which we would train and verify the analytical process. This one is a Random Forest: Through a multiplicity of random samples we did before: our model has to predict the race pf arrestees with respect of the characteristics of the observations included in the samples. By computing an average of their results, we determine the model’s ability to predict. In the figure 3.9, we plot the cofusion matrix. Figure 3.9: Race prediction model We have to look at the sensitivity (ability to predict true positive, here black people) and specificity (ability to predict true negative, here whites), as well the accuracy: if our model well predicts in average the outcome. presented in the table 3.4. Here, the accuracy is a little bit better than hazard (0.6611 against 0.5, considered here as hazard since we have only two outcomes). The sensitivity (.7560) is quite high but specificity is low (.5578). Our model predicts well black but have more difficulty to predict white, which was the issue we faced with our other two models: the white race level is non-significant.
