Eugénie Mathieu, Maeva Marin 24 mai, 2020 Chapter 1 Introduction 1.1 Overview and Motivation Our motivation is to work on the characteristics of arrestations explaining a racial bias of the American judicial system applied. In addition to shootings on public places, cliché rift between black/white people often agitates news and press and stirs up American society. For this project we will use data from Chapel Hill Open Data, which compiles observations on police officers, victims and arrestees. By using the CHPD database, far from finding an universal answer applicable to the United States of America in a whole, because our sample does not allow us to do so, we have the possibility of considering the socio-demographic characteristics of offenders and police officers over a defined time span in order to check whether the cliché racial targetting can be confirmed or refuted. The use of this database potentially allows us to identify some potentially significant correlations between factors of delinquency or bias among police officers Our goal is to find some significant correlation between the variables in order to profile the different offenders and see if these profiles infer with the typical characteristics of police profiles. From sociodemographic of the people arrested do some insight stem on some contributing factors of arrestation among a certain type of population or a precise distribution of offenders, as well as a homogeneous population of victims or not? 1.2 The data As mentioned above, for this assignement we use then Chapel Hill Crime and Police Data. These sets of datasets will focus on gathered information by Chapel Hill on the town and ts citizen. This readme is a compilation of information that represents what each file will be about. Most of the datasets can be understood by reading the summary page from the Chapel Hill Open Data: website We are going to use four differents tables. We didn’t have to do any data cleansing. We only renamed the levels of a few observations for the understanding of the reader (ex: “B” renamed as “Black”). 1.2.1 Police Employee Demographics This dataset contains demographics information for employees of the Chapel Hill Police Department. Current as of October 2016. Observations: 174 Variables: 7 In the table 1.1, we are going to use the 5 followings variables.

Multiple incidents may have been reported at the same time. The most serious incident is shown for each report filed. Data available since January 1, 2010 and updated quarterly. Observations: 82’525 Variables: 18 For this project, we are going to use the 6 variables appearing in the table 1.2. Those variables seems to be the most important for our project.

["exploration-analysis.html", "Chapter 2 Exploration analysis 2.1 Police Employee Demographics 2.2 Victims’ socio-demographics 2.3 Arrestees’ socio-demographics 2.4 Drivers and Passengers’ socio-demographics", " Chapter 2 Exploration analysis In order to have a global overview about our table, we are going to have a zoom on each differents table. 2.1 Police Employee Demographics We start to analyse the dataset of the police officers. We would like to know the proportion of the ethnicities among police officers.We observe in the figure 2.1 that male gender and the white race are in majority. This distribution is captured in the current year of 2016. Figure 2.1: Distribution of the employee Now our interest is to know which positions are the most occupied and by whom. Looking at the distribution of the job class in the figure 2.1, we note that almost all the police positions are attributed to white male people. It is an interesting point for a further analysis. Table 2.1: Profession of the police officers by frequency Job Class Description Gender Race Number of employee POLICE OFFICER IV Male White 27 POLICE OFFICER II Male White 12 RESERVE POLICE OFFICER Male White 11 POLICE OFFICER III Male White 9 POLICE SERGEANT Male White 9 POLICE LIEUTENANT Male White 8 POLICE OFFICER I Male White 8 We found interesting to focus on the above job classes, which work in the field. We filtered thus Job Classes Despcription to obtain a subset including the post that figure in the table 2.1 as the more reccurent. According to some studies run in the field, a chronic stress caused by police work is an explanation of the use of extralegal force (see Griffin 2003, 3–21). In order to set this assumption, we run two investigations: Figure 2.2 depicts the modes of the service lengths among genders for the job cited right above. We observe that the service length is slightly longer for men than for women. The median ongoing career length for men is 15 years, whereas the women’s is approximatively 6 years shorter (-40%). Even if newcomers lower the ongoing service length, such as the outlier in men’s category, we observe that men are thus exposed on a longer period to a chronic stress, which is inherent to the job of police officer (More into details Purba 2019) Figure 2.2: Distribution of the police job Considering now the gender among all categories of job classes, we observe that the police officers are mostly male teams, 2.2. Out of the four grades, there are only 4 women. Women occupy mostly administrative jobs, not linked to the process nor decision making about arrestation. In this way, we can keep in mind that our analysis would focus mainly on male officers. Figure 2.3: Distribution of the job by gender In order to contextualize this information, we had to know when those police officers started their career. We computed easily the age of enrollment for all positions (not only the job classes we filtered before), which is the result of their age minus their service length. The age at which the officers began their career is an important information, because young people are more mentally vulnerable than older ones [more details Thomas ML and al (2016)). Starting one’s career at a young age and being exposed to a chronic stress and traumatic events have more impact on the subject due to one’s age. Among filtered job categories, the starting age is under 30 years old in average, as we observe in the 2.2. All officers were thus early exposed to chronic stress, and more longer if they gained grades. The hierarchy cumulates more years of experience, what is intuitive because of the system of reward and the legitimization to obtain this position: the contrary would have been surprising.The hierarchy is not necessarily playing a direct role in the deicion making of arrestations. Yet, they give orders and guidelines to the police officers, installing a certain culture and mindset to the troops. Police officers’ starting age takes part in the same interval than for their superior : between 25 and 30 years old. We have two police officers above this age, what could be explain by either a late career or a change in district. However, it seems that to reach the fourth level in police officer scale, the experience is a necessary element. Those policemens do not have less than 13 years old of experience, which is a large amount of time spent, by assumption, in streets and on missions. Reserve police officers are experienced policemen kept as an option for mission. For now, we have to ascertain if only those job classes follow the trend of young enrollment or if it is a general tendancy respected by all the human ressources of the CHPD. Figure 2.4: Distribution of the job by gender To match the previous information with race, we observe in this table 2.5 that white employees are generally more experienced due to a longer career. Figure 2.5: Distribution of the job by race 2.2 Victims’ socio-demographics Now, we are going to go through the victims data. We wanted to know the annual number of victims and their characteristics. As a reminder, the data displayd observations from 2010 to 2019. In Figure 2.6, there is a clear distinction between black and white race: white victims outnumber easily black victims.The gender seems not to be significantly important since both graphs look like each other. We keep in mind that gender is not a help, but race plays a great role to profile the victim, among other variables. Figure 2.6: Distribution about the type of the victim Now that we know the distribution of victims, it would be interesting to have a glimpse over the type of issue they suffered from. Therefore, the table 2.2 demonstrates the most frequent complaints involve theft. The third and fourth most frequent issues reported are “misc officier in” and “domestic distur”. Table 2.2: )Purpose of the crime Reported As Victim Race Victim Gender Number of victim THEFT/LARCENY White Male 957 THEFT/LARCENY White Female 898 MISC OFFICER IN White Female 442 DOMESTIC DISTUR Black Female 391 MISC OFFICER IN White Male 379 DOMESTIC DISTUR White Female 356 BURGLARY/HOME I White Male 319 PUBLIC SERVICE White Female 311 SUSPICIOUS/WANT White Female 309 BURGLARY/HOME I White Female 306 In the figure 2.7, we would like to know if there is a difference in process time for registering the complaint and the the arrestation process among race of victims. Even if there are some variations depending on the complexity of the case and the inherent time of investigation depending on the type of case, variation we cannot control, it would be interesting if there are anyway a global difference since our panel of 82’525 observations would somehow pool this variance. Outliers are the typical cases showing this uncontrollable variation, we would neglect them and filter our dataset to observe only the delays inferior to 2000 days (more than 3 years). We observe that the time dedicated to investigation and arrestation for cases of white people is slightly higher than this time for black people. We would discard the assumption of a negligence in the treatment of cases related to black people. Figure 2.7: Bloxplot about the delay between the occurence and the report 2.3 Arrestees’ socio-demographics In the data “Police arrested made”, there are all the data of the criminals for their arrest from 2010 to 2019. The first thing we wished to observe is the number of arrests per month and per year (for a better visualization) classified by race of the person arrested. In Figures 2.8 and 2.9, we observe that from 2015, the number of arrestations for black people increases. The below figures show the number of arrestations by race and we note an equivalent proportion of black and white arestees. However, if we confront this information with the socio-demographic data of White Chapel in 2010, the black population represented only 9.9%. According to the data of 2020 World Population by Country(updated daily) displaying the population of Chapel Hill and its population growth, the population growth between 2010 and 2018 was 6.24%, so let’s assume that the population of black people increased by the same percentage, and the variation would be +/- 6.24% [0% or 12.48%] It would lead that in 2018, on year before our data, we should have 10.5% of black people in White Chapel Hill or a percentage included in [9.9% ; 11.17%]. Here, if we had to respect the proportion in the arrestee sample according to the white people number of arestees, it should be around 386 black aresteesin order to be representative of the whole population. The entered 3’651 black arrestees represent 945% of this extrapolation. Since 2015, the trend is inverted and black arrestees sometimes outnumbers white people. Sometimes, the difference is shocking, for instance in March-April and July-August 2016 or June-July 2018. These differences are peaks that could be related to the meeting and strikes related to black shooting occuring in the year and to repeal a law (HB2), as the articles enclosed in the appendix relate.(Grubb 2020, title “Hundreds block downtown Chapel Hill to protest state’s HB2 law”) We do neglect the possibility that mass movements could as well explain unusual peaks. However, as we mentioned earlier, the inverted trend is significantly verified in 2017, where white arrestees were a majority only during two first months. This fact could not be explained by mass movements. Figure 2.8: Evolution of the number of arrestation by month Figure 2.9: Evolution of the number of arrestation by year After dividing the arrests by class, we wanted to know the gender of the arrestees and we observed, in the figure 2.10, that the number of men is in average 3 times the number of arrested women, both races combined. The male arrestees number remains above the 600 for white and for black (except in 2012, around 580) from 2010 to 2015. Until that date, Black arrestees’ number belongs to an approximate interval of [580;800], with a high increase between 2012-2015 (approx. +35%). White arrestees belongs to the interval [600:800]. Both races decreases tremendously afterwards, but the black community always remains higher of +50 numbers of arrestees in average, which denotes well the disparity among races. In 2015, some institutional policy must have been applied to decrease the number of arrestee preventively or punishingly because the number of arrestees has decreased for both white and black citizens. The trend of a decrease in the number of arrestees is observed one year later for women: in 2016. Women arrestees number is quite stable, oscillating in an interval of [100;200] for white women and [50;150] Figure 2.10: Evolution of the number of arrestation between male and female And what about their ages? The age and the race would complete the profile of our arrestees. White arrestees are slightly younger (27-28 yo) considering the median than black people (34-35yo), Even the 1rst and 3rd modes are present a difference of about 5 years, making black arestees older. And we note that the mean age of black arrestees in slightly superior to the white arrestees mean age. The mean ages are respectedly 33 years for black people and 25 for white people, as observed in the figure 2.11. Figure 2.11: Age of the arrested people related to the race We would now consider the type of arrestations 2.12. Black arrestees have more chance to be taken into custody than white people (chance until 2 times the white people have in 2011). It’s hitting to remark that the heavier measures police officers could apply to arrestees is attributed in those proportions to black people and this difference in treatment among races remains quite stable. Each year verifying the schocking gap between white and black arrestees taken into custody. Since 2012, the black proportion of peolple summoned or cited increased to reach 300 arrestees per year, in 2015 and 2016. The curve for white arrestees depicts a yearly decrease, starting in 2010 with a number higher than 400, reaching a flat stage for about 3 years (2012-2015) and the decreased has accelerated since this moment. However, we note that in this category as well, the curves of respectively black and white people arrested have become mixed for the past 5 years, making this sample as well not representative for the entire population of Chapel Hill. The same comment could be made for arrestees categorized “on view”&quot;, with a tinier gap between white and black people, but always at the cost of black persons. Figure 2.12: Number of arrestation separeted by type and race Victims and arrestees are now confronted in order to now the distribution of conflicts 2.3. The interracial conflicts are lower than white vs white and black vs black complaints. The proportion of white victims here, neglecting any observations involving other races (Asian, Hispanic, etc.), is a subset closer to the real population. Black victims represent 34.31% of this sample of victims, whereas the real proportion of black is approx. 10% over 100% of population. In spite the 34.31% is clearly a higher rate than the proportion of black victims we could have expected, we won’t investigate the potential causes of this great rate. The point here is really to confront racial and interracial conflicts distribution. Table 2.3: Vertical = Victim | Horizontal = Arrested Asian Black Hispanic Native American Other Unknown White Asian 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Black 0 15484 0 0 0 0 14667 Hispanic 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Native American 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Other 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Unknown 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 White 0 43176 0 0 0 0 44701 2.4 Drivers and Passengers’ socio-demographics Finally, we decided to analyse the traffic arrestation and again to differentiate black to white people. To do so, we chose an alternative method based on percentage: a ratio determining how many black citizens more were arrested for a certain motive of arrestx, scaled by the number of white arrestees, per year. The most striking information is the ratio is the highest for police investigation. In other words, for each 10 white citizen arrested for investigation, whatever the gender is, at least 16 black persons already have been arrested. Those 60% of difference between those two races clearly signifies a correlated disproportion. However, narrowing down the specific cause of it is impossible and is not part of the present work. The reader has to keep in mind the black inhabitants’ proportion in demographics dated 2010 in Chapel Hill (10%) and our extrapolation: (+/- 1.2%) per year, with respect to the whole population. The present arrestees sample is absolutely not representative of our population, even if estimated. In Figure 2.13, if the bar is higher than 50%, it mean that more black persons are arrested and inversely. We note that for the purpose “Investigation”, more black are arrested for the both year and independently of the gender. The feature “Driving while impaired”&quot; concern mostly black males. Figure 2.13: More black are arrested To refine the exploration, we want to know what type of arrest prevails per year 2.14. The strict majority among arrestation categories is speed limit violation, which overpass 4’000 arrestations per year, in both 2014 and 2015, and whose gender proportion approximate a 55%-45% (quite homogeneous). Speed violation is a daily risk for drivers, whether it is voluntary done or not. For this reason, speed violation was intuititive first cause of verbalization. The second and third causes of arrest concerned violation of vehicle regulations or equipment regulations. Which is interesting to note here is that the first causes of arrests, whose number of occurences exploded in 2014 and 2015, concerns a behavioral cause. Behavioral causes could imply violent reactions from police officers who are/feel agressed, whereas non-behavioral causes (ex. vehicule equipment violation) lead less to violence or other bias in decision making for arresting the verbalized person(s). Other behavioral causes are fewly reported: (safe or other) movement violations, driving whiled impaired, etc. Offensive or violent behaviors are not significantly represented here other than potentially trhough speed violation which, as we previously said, could be unwanted.

["modeling.html", "Chapter 3 Modeling 3.1 Modeling - Arrestees 3.2 Modelling - Victim 3.3 With a poisson distribution 3.4 Classifying", " Chapter 3 Modeling Once the exploration analysis done, we pursue with the modelization of the profile of our arrestees and victims. As a gentle reminder, the aim of our project is to build the typical profil drawn by the database in order to know whether or not race has a strong influence and thus, to consider if there is objectively a partial legal force. 3.1 Modeling - Arrestees 3.1.1 With a normal distribution We would first build the model for arrestee’s profile. In order to do so, we use a gaussian General Linear Model to shape our dependent variable, the number of arrestation, explain by our independent variables: the age, race and gender of the arrestee and if it was under the influence of drugs and alcool. We use dummy variables to better understand the impact of the outcomes. model &lt;- glm( arrestation ~ `Arrestee&#39;s Age`+`Arrestee&#39;s Race`+`Arrestee&#39;s Gender` + `Drugs or Alcohol Present`, data = Arrestation ) We observe that ceteris paribus, approximatively 49 arrestations (intercept) would be done in our reference case as we could observe in the table 3.1. The reference case is the average of possibility between all combinations possible with our variable references and here, since we have dummy variables, it encompasses the lowest probable profile of arrestees: black women. This reference level gives the irreductible number of arrestations the Chapel Hill Police District would operate for this category on this subset of pupulation over 9 years. The arrestee Age has a negative effect: it depicts that higher is the age of the arrestee lower is the probability to encounter this person, since a high age would decrease, ceteris paribus, the number of arrestations in fine by the exact value of the age of the arrestee. This coefficient is significant. The other significant coefficients are the gender of the arrestee and the presence of drugs and alcool, the last information is divided into two significant dummy variables. Being a male would higher by almost 29 additional arrestations, ceteris paribus. The male gender has a strong effect: + 58.10% of arrestations. Drugs and alcohol dummy variables have as wellspring effects: The unknown presence of those substances decrease our outcome by approx. 16 arrestations (-15.63), ceteris paribus, while their presence would increase by almost 19 arrestations (18.83). Unfortunately, this model does not give us the expect insight on race: being white is positively correlated with the number of arrestation, making white race a more probable characteristic in the typical arrestee profile. We should have intuitively deducted that indeed, however the coefficient is not significant. Table 3.1: Information about the estimate of the model term estimate std.error p.value (Intercept) 49.24 3.57 0 *** Arrestee's Age -1.00 0.06 0 *** Arrestee's RaceWhite 1.38 2.02 0.4955 Arrestee's GenderMale 28.61 2.03 0 *** Drugs or Alcohol PresentUnknown -15.67 2.51 0 *** Drugs or Alcohol PresentYes 18.83 2.41 0 *** Those informations brought by the model are themselves accurate? To know it, we have to analyse the goodness of fit of the model and explore in more details the distribution of the errors and also the distribution or our data. In Figure 3.1, we observe exterme value, which have a lot of weight concerning the distribution of our errors. Figure 3.1: Residuals of the models about the arrested With the following table 3.5, we have a look on the extreme values of the above figures. The tricky exercise here is to understand that the extreme values are not: they are the frequency of the profiles of people arrested: the white male with drugs and alcohol is y very common profile in the database, wherease the other combinations, representing one single person, exceed 180 different single profiles. Table 3.2: Standard profile depending of the frequency of arrestations Arrestee’s Age Arrestee’s Race Arrestee’s Gender Drugs or Alcohol Present arrestation 21 White Male Yes 331 20 White Male Yes 294 19 White Male Yes 260 22 White Male Yes 260 18 White Male Yes 172 23 White Male Yes 155 24 White Male Yes 155 Concerning the predictions of our response variable “Arrestation”, we can observe in the figure 3.2, that our predictions and our observed values overlap, which is good news. On the other hand, our model has difficulty in predicting extreme values, especially for the white race. Figure 3.2: Prediction But unfortunately we are not totally satisfied with our model: the residues are very high and our data does not follow a normal dsitribution. We can improve our model by changing the distribution. Therefore, now we do the same model and use a poisson distribution. 3.1.2 With a poisson distribution Normal distribution describes continuous data which have a symmetric distribution, with a characteristic ‘bell’ shape, which is not the case in our data, as we observed in the figure 3.1. Therefore, to analyze the leeway of improvement of our model, we use the Poisson distribution and expect lower residuals and a better overall fit. model_poisson &lt;- glm( arrestation ~ `Arrestee&#39;s Age`+`Arrestee&#39;s Race`+`Arrestee&#39;s Gender` + `Drugs or Alcohol Present`, data = Arrestation, family = &quot;poisson&quot; ) All our estimates are significant with 0.1% except for the variable race as we observe in the table 3.3. By comparison with the normal model (3.1) the variable sginificance are the same. Only the intercept is modified, which is smaller than previously, 3.84 instead of 49.24. The effect of the estimate remains similar and as previously, variable race isn’t significant. Table 3.3: Information about the estimate of the model term estimate std.error p.value (Intercept) 3.84 0.03 0 *** Arrestee's Age -0.04 0.00 0 *** Arrestee's RaceWhite 0.00 0.02 0.8462 Arrestee's GenderMale 1.37 0.02 0 *** Drugs or Alcohol PresentUnknown -0.98 0.03 0 *** Drugs or Alcohol PresentYes 0.67 0.02 0 *** In the figure, 3.3 we compare the distribution of the errors between the gaussian and the Poisson models. The first tables depicts the distribution of the residuals at the same scale (until -200). The gaussian residuals are greater than Poisson ones: the latter distribution better fits our dataset. In a second time, we zoom in on the Poisson residuals to observe their distribution into an tiny interval of [-10, 10], which is pretty good. Figure 3.3: Residuals of the models about the arrested In the next model, we add the type of arrest and whether the criminal is armed or not, in order to explain our response variable “Arrest”. And this time, we use directly a poisson distribution. model_Arrestation_2 = glm(arrestation ~ `Arrestee&#39;s Age`+`Arrestee&#39;s Race`+`Arrestee&#39;s Gender` + `Drugs or Alcohol Present` + `Type of Arrest` + `Weapon Present`,family=&quot;poisson&quot;, data= Arrestation_2) Compare to our previous model with less variables, the significance of the estimates does not change. The type of arrestations “Taken into custody” and being “Unarmed” are significant with 0.1%, as we observe in the table 3.5. Table 3.4: Information about the estimate of the model term estimate std.error p.value Arrestee's Age -0.04 0.00 0 *** Arrestee's GenderMale 1.22 0.03 0 *** Drugs or Alcohol PresentYes 0.64 0.02 0 *** Type of ArrestTAKEN INTO CUSTODY -0.24 0.03 0 *** Weapon PresentUNARMED 2.82 0.50 0 *** The table 3.5 gives the most frequent profiles contained in our databases of arrested persons, including now type of arrests and drug or alcohol impaired. Again, the profils of young white males are the most frequent, and they are systematically not armed but impaired. Table 3.5: Information about the estimate of the model Arrestee’s Age Arrestee’s Race Arrestee’s Gender Drugs or Alcohol Present Type of Arrest Weapon Present arrestation 20 White Male Yes SUMMONED/CITED UNARMED 124 21 White Male Yes ON VIEW UNARMED 111 19 White Male Yes SUMMONED/CITED UNARMED 108 21 White Male Yes SUMMONED/CITED UNARMED 104 22 White Male Yes ON VIEW UNARMED 95 22 White Male Yes SUMMONED/CITED UNARMED 77 45 Black Male Yes SUMMONED/CITED UNARMED 71 3.2 Modelling - Victim 3.2.1 With a normal distribution The second modelization aims to model the profil of victims. Again, we use the simplest model possible: the gaussian General Linear model, to estimate the number of victims by population characteristics over 9 years. The variable taking into account the age, race and gender of the victims. We reproduce the distinguo gaussian-Poisson as we did for arrestees’ profiling in order to demonstrate again the better fit of the data by the use of a Poisson. model_victim = glm(Victim ~ `Victim Age` + `Victim Gender` + `Victim Race` , data= Victim) Again, we have a model with dummy variables (automatically created by the use of character variables, the software estimate the impact of the non-reference levels), so we have to first consider our reference level, which is black women, as we observe in the table 3.6. The number of victims for those population, neglecting the age is approximatively 201 cases (200.56). This number is significant. Considering now our variables: The age is negatively correlated with the number of victims by decreasing it with an effect of -2.70! We expect thus a larger number of young victims, since this coefficient is reliable since significant. Being white is a risk factor: more victims are white and this is represented by the strong positive effect of the dummy variable, significant as well, called `Victim Race’White: +86.79 so additional 87 number of victims by comparison to our reference level. Here, we have a strong racial effect: black people report less in our data set: they seem to be less subject to misuse, aggressions, and other cases of abi. than white people. But exogeneous causes can cause it: white persons are maybe wealthier or adopt a behavioral attracting thiefs, perhaps black people are reluctant to fill a complaint in police office because of some pression, lack of interest or expecting disparagement, for exmaple. Our database cannot help any supporting justification with those assumptions, because it does not contain any data to verify them. Finally, the interesting point remains that gender is not significant, in spite of the negative effect (in the model, but a benefit in reality) to be a male. Being a male decreases, ceteris paribus, the number of cases by approximatively 13 victims (13.42). Table 3.6: Information about the estimate of the model term estimate std.error p.value (Intercept) 200.6 10.05 0 *** Victim Age -2.7 0.15 0 *** Victim GenderMale -13.4 6.79 0.0489 * Victim RaceWhite 86.8 6.80 0 *** The similar analysis of errors of arrestees could be applied here: error values follow a curve illustrating quite a poisson distribution. In Figure 3.4, residuals are centered around zero, but follow an incresing trend. Figure 3.4: Residuals of the models about the model victim In order to well undersant what is inside the extreme value as we obsevre the figure 3.4, we present the seven typical profil of a victim , in the table 3.7, we notice that the victim is all the time a young white person. Table 3.7: Information about the estimate of the model Victim Age Victim Gender Victim Race Victim 21 Female White 755 21 Male White 636 22 Female White 513 20 Female White 510 22 Male White 481 20 Male White 462 19 Female White 324 The box plot of the model’s goodness of fit points out that our model better predict black than white people: the dummy variable struggles to well fit the observation, as we notice in the figure 3.5 Figure 3.5: Prediction victim model 3.3 With a poisson distribution Like for the model of the arrestee profile, we improve our modelization by running after a Poisson model below: model_victim_poisson = glm(Victim ~ `Victim Age` + `Victim Gender` + `Victim Race` ,family = &quot;poisson&quot;, data= Victim) Again, we have a model with dummy variables, so we have to first consider our reference level, which is black women again, as we observe in the table 3.8. All the variables are significant as in the previsous table with a normal distribution 3.6. But here, all the variables are significant with 0.1%, which it was not the case previously. Here the varaibles male is negatively signicant, and before it was positively correlated. It is more correct to use this following table 3.8. Table 3.8: Information about the estimate of the model term estimate std.error p.value (Intercept) 5.50 0.02 0 *** Victim Age -0.03 0.00 0 *** Victim GenderMale -0.14 0.01 0 *** Victim RaceWhite 1.10 0.01 0 *** Plotting our residuals with a Poisson distribution, the Poisson model demonstrates again a better fit to the data. The errors are reduced in a smaller interval than the normal residuals and remains low as for the extreme values (i.e. the most typical profiles of person arrested), what the normal distribution struggles to do it. The improvement we expeccted by using a Poisson distribution is again satisfactory here: 3.6. Figure 3.6: Residuals of the models about the model victim 3.4 Classifying Finally, because no variable concerning the arrestee’s race was significant, we would now see with a machine learning process if the black box is able to well predict the skin color of the person arrested. If the process succeeds, then there would be an evidence that black or white race might have an affect on arrestation in the District of Chapel Hill because they can be predicted by the variables we selected for the model: the characteristics of the arrestations would be a key factor to forecast the skin color of the arrestee. If not, then our data base does not allow us to demonstrate any bias in the judicial system of a county if ad only if our samples are respresentative of our population. If this is not the case, then further investigation have be done in order to minimize the sampling bias we face here. So, we filtered again the data to have only black and white arrestees and mutate all the character variables as factors, so as to be handled by the functions, which require factors only. We proceed to a sammpling for having a training and a test sets with which we would train and verify the analytical process. This one is a Random Forest: Through a multiplicity of random samples we did before: our model has to predict the race pf arrestees with respect of the characteristics of the observations included in the samples. By computing an average of their results, we determine the model’s ability to predict. In the figure 3.7, we plot the cofusion matrix. Figure 3.7: Race prediction model We have to look at the sensitivity (ability to predict true positive, here black people) and specificity (ability to predict true negative, here whites), as well the accuracy: if our model well predicts in average the outcome, in the table 3.5. Here, the accuracy is a little bit better than hazard (0.6611 against 0.5, considered here as hazard since we have only two outcomes). The sensitivity (.7560) is quite high but specificity is low (.5578). Our model predicts well black but have more difficulty to predict white, which was the issue we faced with our other two models: the white race level is non-significant. Of course, we are now working with a biased sample. The learner’s struggles are explained to a certain extent by this bias. The improvements we could have done would have been to create a subset of our dataset by randomly selecting 10% of black arrestees and 90% of white arrestees to respect the real proportion of Chapel Hill’s population. In this way, the learner would have work on less biased subset of observations and the results would have given us a better classification of arrestees per skin color.

["conclusion.html", "Chapter 4 Conclusion", " Chapter 4 Conclusion Our project was to determine if a bias could be observable and if some characteristics were significantly attributable to white and black races. To do so and after a comprehensive exploratory analysis on victims, police officers and arrestees, we created two models, a gaussian and a Poisson, to model the actual proportions of arrestees, and then a Random forest to classify them by their characteristics. We used a biased sample and we knew that it is questionable to proceed with a non-representative sampling to draw conclusions needing careful handling. The 50-50 proportion of black and white among arrestees cannot represent the Chapel Hill’s population where black people are up to max. 12.5%. We start easy with a simple gaussian model and refined it with a Poisson family, what better fits the data by reducing drast. Our linear models were somehow satisfying, mostly the Poisson one: coefficients were significant except the Arrestee race. This is an interesting insight: in fact, a model using a biased 50-50 sample making no difference between white and black people in its outcome precisely points out a problem. Our regression tree is good at predicting black people (True Positive), a bit less in white arrestees (True Negative). In addition, it did errors of type I and II in non negligible proportion. (false black / white arrestee). We should have either weighting the outcomes to cope with this mix up, or randomly resample our dataset to obtain a representative subset and to train our classification model on it. Our project gives some insights from the start on a potential racial bias: the dataset is itself not representative. We must as well remind that Chapel Hill is a State of South and might be impacted by its history, and using only one dataset does not allow us to draw universal conclusion, as we said in the introduction. However, we dare say that a racial bias might be observable in the judicial system of Chapell Hill between 2015 and 2019, but must be further investigated to scope out the correlation between the police officers’ profiles and the arrestees typical profiles, and the characteristics imputable to the races among arrestees and police officers.
