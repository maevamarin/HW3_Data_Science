# Basic instructions

To obtain the maximum number of points, use whenever possible:

* the pipeline symbol %>%,
* `dplyr` verbs,
* `kable` to print tables,
* `ggplot` to produce the figures,
* `purrr`'s functions to minimize code duplication,
* `broom`'s functions to format the results model fits.

Also: 

* Pay attention to the general aesthetics of your report (i.e., formatting of 
the tables, sizing of the figures, etc.). 
* Use inline code to display single numbers, and `echo = FALSE` for code chunks when you display 
a table of produce a figure (i.e., we don't want to see code unless it is necessary).
* Minimize the amount of code duplication by using iterations concepts and list-columns.
* Comment your code to explain what you are doing.
